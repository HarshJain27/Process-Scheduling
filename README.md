# Process-Scheduling
Process Scheduling using Multilevel Feedback Queue

Implemented Multilevel Feedback Queue with two levels: 
Level 1 :  Fixed priority pre-emptive Scheduling 
Level 2 :  Round Robin Scheduling

1. Fixed priority Pre-emptive Scheduling (Queue 1) 
Priority 0 is highest priority. 
Quantum : 4 unit time 

2. Round Robin Scheduling (Queue 2) 
Quantum : 4 unit time 
All the processes in second level queue will complete their execution according to round robin scheduling. 
Queue 2 will be processed after Queue 1 becomes empty.   
Priority of Queue 2 is lower than that of Queue 1.
